by Katherine E. M. Miller, Katherine Ornstein, and Norma B. Coe

**Overview:**

Before running the code:

- Change the file path of the data and output global statements at the beginning of each .do file to the location of the project folder

Once these changes have been made, running the file labeled "0\_Primary File" will construct the analytic data set and produce all output values to replicate findings as reported in the manuscript.

For questions about the code, please contact Katherine Miller (Katherine.miller@pennmedicine.upenn.edu).

**Data required:**

First, HRS Restricted Geographic data permissions will be required. Second, the sample constructed for the paper "Informal and Formal Home Care For Older Adults With Disabilities Increased, 2004â€“16" by Van Houtven et al. (2020) will be required.
